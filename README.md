# Room-Mapping-Robot
A Python application that simulates a robot driving around a room whilst creating a map of it. It is created using Python 3, PyQt5 and sqlite.

This project was completed as part of my A Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment. The design document submitted alongside it is included in the repository, with sensitive information and the appendix which contained the entire codebase removed.
